### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

   I'm Srinivas, but most people call me Srini. Welcome to my Github page!.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on enhancing my overall knowledge of CS and the bigger picture of how the Web works. Also building a ML Model to identify Aortic Dissection in Computed Tomography Angiography images, so that's pretty cool.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the MERN stack, PyTorch, Image Segmentation (with a bit of Tennis and Table Tennis on the side).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Web Dev projects, or anything cool that happens to involve a lot of programming :)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: srinivasilancheran@gmail.com
